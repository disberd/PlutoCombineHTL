This is a package containing some helper types and functions to create HTML/javascript snippets by combining subparts generated in Julia. 
It is developed specifically with Pluto.jl as target environment for use. This was a submodule of [PlutoDevMacros.jl](https://github.com/disberd/PlutoDevMacros.jl) till its 0.8 version, where it was removed to reduce dependencies.
I have not used it in a while as I am experimenting different ways of simplifying writing javascript snippets for use within Pluto.
